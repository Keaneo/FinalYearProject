# FinalYearProject

For the full version including data & graphs the zip folder is here:

# Usage
Files in the 'scripts' folder are the relevant code files.  
'runScripts' is an easy script to trigger most functions from - use a parfor loop for sorting data  
sort_three_d_choices()/outcomes() are the functions used to sort for use with trigger_mvgc()

More documentation coming soon - relevant functions are commented, better instructions for use will be written soon.
